# Small-Office-Network
A comprehensive network design and implementation for a 600-user small office, covering planning, VLAN segmentation, device configuration, and security

## Project Overview
This project designs and implements a scalable network infrastructure for a small office with around 600 users. It includes network planning, VLAN segmentation, device configuration, and security features to ensure efficient, secure, and reliable connectivity across departments.

## Features
- **Hierarchical Network Design**: Organized topology with VLANs for each department.
- **Device Configuration**: Configured routers and switches with secure SSH access, DHCP, and Inter-VLAN routing.
- **Network Security**: Implemented Access Control Lists (ACLs) and port security to control access and prevent unauthorized devices.
- **Advanced Routing and NAT**: Configured OSPF for efficient routing and NAT/PAT for IP management.
- **Wireless and Remote Access**: WLAN access enabled for wireless devices; remote management setup with SSH.

## Technologies Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: For network design and simulation.
- **Networking Protocols**: VLANs, DHCP, ACLs, NAT, OSPF, and SSH.
- **Hardware**: Cisco Routers and Switches for core networking.
